**Your Body, Your Choice… Unless You’re A Woman Apparently**

As of recently, the right to an abortion–guaranteed and protected by the Supreme Court in 1973 through the passing of Roe v Wade–is under attack. Currently, the majority of the Supreme Court justices are those who have always opposed the right to an abortion. Because of this newly leaning-right court, the possibility of an overturn is significantly high.  

We need you, the female population, the advocates for freedom of choice, to stand together and ensure that the government does not infringe on bodily autonomy. In the event that Roe v Wade is overturned, we shall expect to see 26 states already prepared to enforce abortion bans. With this implementation, 36 million women would lose access to reproductive-related healthcare services. The government has no right to dictate what a woman can do to their body. This should not be a political issue, this is a choice for each woman to decide. 


What _YOU_ need to do:

* VOTE! Both local and federal elections
* March 
* Spread awareness of the threat that we are facing, through starting conversations
* Take to social media, to further spread awareness to those all around the world
* Sign petitions 
* Write to congress and local representatives to demand that they stand with you and reproductive rights
* Donate to organizations such as Planned Parenthood, ACLU, or other organizations that are joining the fight for our rights to our body.
